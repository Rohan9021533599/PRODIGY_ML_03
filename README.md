This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs using the Kaggle "Dogs vs Cats" dataset.

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an image belongs to a cat or a dog. The images are first preprocessed by resizing and converting them into numerical feature vectors. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. The SVM model is then trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data.
